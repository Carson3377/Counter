JavaScript Project --
# Counter

In this JavaScript project, we're going to create a counter that counts infinitely in both positive and negative values. It changes colour based on either positive or negative number. Creating a simple counter like this requires the application of DOM manipulation, good thing is you'll get to practice and get the hang of using DOM in JavaScript.

The JavaScript key methods may be applied:

- document.querySelectorAll() & document.querySelector()
--> Select all of the same element 'btn' and also the first element selected '#value'.


- forEach()
--> Target each of the elements in an array or non-array elements.


- addEventListener()
--> Applies an event listener to listen to what event is used, 'click'.


- currentTarget
--> Return the element 'btn' whose event listener triggered the event and "e", Event object is being fired and caused the function to be executed.


- classList
--> Return CSS classnames 'btn' of element


- textContent
--> Return the specified text content


- If else statement
--> Determine the positive and negative values and their colour differences
---> There's a slight change in 'If else statement', I switched the "reset" button to ELSE IF statement, and "increase" button to ELSE statement. Due to the malfunction, when clicking on the "Increasing" button had no changes or increase.


- contains()
--> Returns true if a node is a descendant of a node, and false if not


That's a wrap!
